## Features
Our Quick Instagram Profile checker allows you to scrape top recent posts and videos from a user's profile page along with profile details without login or special proxy. For more advanced usage please consider [Instagram Scraper](https://apify.com/jaroslavhejlek/instagram-scraper)
 
Or let us know if you need a [custom Instagram scraping solution](https://apify.com/custom-solutions).

## Why scrape Instagram?
Since this actor is very savvy on resources you can run it as often as you want to be able to collect all new posts or track stats over time in a same style as provided by i.e. SocialBlade.
If you need more details or functionality like search you need to have access to residential proxies and use full [Instagram Scraper](https://apify.com/jaroslavhejlek/instagram-scraper)

If you want more ideas, check out our [industries pages](https://apify.com/industries) for ways web scraping is already being used in a wide range of companies.

## Is it legal to scrape Instagram?
Our Instagram scrapers are ethical and do not extract any private user data, such as email addresses, gender, or location. They only extract what the user has chosen to share publicly. We therefore believe that our scrapers, when used for ethical purposes by Apify users, are safe. However, you should be aware that your results could contain personal data. Personal data is protected by the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) in the European Union and by other regulations around the world. You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so. If you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. You can also read our blog post on the [legality of web scraping](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/).
